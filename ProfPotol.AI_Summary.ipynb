        "1. В ходе подготовительного этапа проекта - НИРа по исследованию ДС - были сделаны выводы о невалидности предоставленного датасета. Основными тезисами стали:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Скудная заполненность\n",
        "  * Жуткая разбалансировка\n",
        "\n",
        "  Кроме данных тезисов, результатом НИРа стал обрезанный датасет, сохранивший наибольшее число записей, доступных для обучения, но потерявший значительное количество колонок.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Вторым этапом проекта стала Практическая Реализация и Проверка Гипотез. Результатом работа стала обученная модель, готовая к эксплуатации. Модель была проверена на тестовой выборке. Тесты показали объективность гипотез НИРа и подтвердили их, а именно:\n",
        "  \n",
        "  * В связи со скудной заполненностью датасета неизбежным становится переобучение модели. Все возможные методы: от изменения архитектуры НС до настройки гиперпараметров - позволяют снизить эффект переобучения, но ни один из них не позволяет в полной степени нивелировать его.\n",
        "  * Расбалансировка датасета, примитивно выражаясь, приводит модель к выводу о том, что выдавая результат \"ГОДЕН\", она практически каждый раз угадает ответ. Этот феномен приводит к поглащению прочих предполагаемых выводы выводом \"ГОДЕН\", что, в свою очередь, так же ложно формирует показатель точности в 95+%. Данный материал наглядно отражён тепловой картой матрицы ошибок соответсвующего раздела.\n",
        "\n",
        "Заключением проделанной работы является вывод (выведенный теоретически и подкреплённый практическим примером) о том, что предоставленный датасет плох и не подходит для решения поставленной задачи."
